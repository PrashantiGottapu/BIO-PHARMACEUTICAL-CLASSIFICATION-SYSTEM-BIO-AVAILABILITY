# BIO-PHARMACEUTICAL-CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM-BIO-AVAILABILITY
Solubility of a drug plays a very important role in determining the dose of the drug to be
taken since it has a major impact on the bioavailability/ therapeutic efficiency. Presently there
is a considerable interest in improving the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs. Due to the
poor bioavailability of the new drug entities, high inter/ intra subject variability is being
observed in patients consuming these drugs. When the drugs suffer from highly variable
bioavailability, it becomes difficult for the clinician to fix a dosage regimen. The drug must
get solubilised in the gastro intestinal fluids or in aqueous medium and also should possess
permeability properties for good membrane diffusion in order for it to reach the blood stream
and show good bioavailability. For this purpose drug substances are categorized into four
classes based on their solubility and permeability parameters namely, Biopharmaceutical
Classification System (BCS). BCS considers into account the following three in vitro
parameters i.e. solubility, permeability and dissolution 1 .
Objectives of BCS
1. To improve the efficiency of the drug development and review process by recommending
a strategy for identifying expendable clinical bioequivalence test.
2. To recommend a class of immediate-release (IR) solid oral dosage forms for which
bioequivalence may be assessed based on in vitro dissolution tests.
3. To recommend methods for classification according to dosage form dissolution along with
the solubility–permeability characteristics of the drug product 2 .
Classes of BCS
Class I: High Solubility - High Permeability

Class II: Low Solubility - High Permeability
Class III: High Solubility - Low Permeability
Class IV: Low Solubility - Low Permeability
Class I drugs exhibits high absorption and as well as high dissolution rate. Drug dissolution
is the rate limiting step and if the dissolution is very fast then the gastric emptying rate
becomes the rate determining step. Rate of absorption is higher than rate of excretion. E.g.
metoprolol, diltiazem, verapamil and propranolol.
Class II drugs have high absorption rate but their dissolution rate is low. In vivo drug
dissolution is the rate limiting step for absorption except at a higher dose value. The
absorption for Class II drugs is slower than that of Class I drugs and occurs over longer
periods of time. In vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) is usually accepted for Class I and Class
II drugs. E.g. phenytoin, danazol, ketoconazole, mefenamic acid and nifedipine.
Permeability is a rate limiting step in the case of Class III drugs. Drug absorption exhibits
there is high variation in the rate and extent of drug absorption. Since the dissolution is rapid,
the variation is attributable to alteration of physiology and membrane permeability rather than
the dosage form factors. E.g. cimetidine, acyclovir, neomycin B and captopril.
Class IV drugs present a number of problems when given Class IV drugs are considered to
be suffering from variable bioavailability. Some examples of class IV drugs are taxol and
griseofulvin 3 .
Parameters of BCS
In BCS the drugs are classified on the basis of their solubility and permeability and
dissolution parameters. The class boundaries for the parameters are:

1. Solubility class boundaries- A drug substance is considered to be highly soluble when the
highest dose strength is soluble in 250 mL of water over a pH range 1 to 7.5.
2. Permeability class boundaries- A drug is considered to be highly permeable when the
extent of absorption in humans is found to be 90% of an administered dose, based on the
mass balance or in comparison to an intravenous dose.
3. Dissolution class boundaries- A drug product is considered to be dissolving rapidly when
85% of the labelled amount of the drug substance dissolves within 30 minutes, upon usage of
USP apparatus I or II in a volume of 900 mL buffer solution 3 .
SOLUBILITY DETERMINATION
Solubility can be defined as the amount of substance that has passed into solution when
equilibrium is attained between the solution and excess (undissolved substance) at a given
temperature and pressure. A drug substance or an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is
considered highly soluble when the highest dose strength is soluble in 250 mL or less of
aqueous medium over a specific pH range. The pH solubility profile of the drug substance is
determined at 37±1ºC in aqueous medium with pH in the range of 1-7.5, 1.2-6.8 and 1-8 as
per United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), World Health Organization
(WHO) and European Medicines Academy (EMEA) guidelines. A number of pH conditions
for the accurate pH-solubility profile should be evaluated and it depends upon the ionization
characteristics of the test drug substance. A minimum of three replicate determinations of
solubility in each pH condition should be carried out for accurate results. Standard buffer
solutions described in pharmacopoeiae are considered appropriate in solubility studies.
Methods other than shake-flask method can also be used to predict the equilibrium solubility
of test drug substance. If degradation of drug has occurred because of buffer composition
and/or pH, it should be taken into consideration. The concentration of drug substance in

selected buffers or pH conditions should be determined using a validated solubility indicating
assay method that can distinguish the drug substances from its degradation products 4 .
PERMEABILITY DETERMINATION
Permeability and solubility form the backbone of BCS that helps in assessing oral absorption
of drug molecules. Different methods used for the determination of permeability are as
follows:
1. Pharmacokinetic studies in human subjects including mass balance studies and
absolute bioavailability (BA) studies or intestinal permeability methods.
2. In vivo or in situ intestinal perfusion in a suitable animal model.
3. In vitro permeability methods using excised intestinal tissues.
4. Monolayers of suitable epithelial cells e.g. Caco-2 cells or TC-7 cells.
In mass balance studies, to determine the extent of drug absorption, unlabeled, stable
isotopes or radiolabeled drug substances are used. In absolute BA studies, oral BA is
determined and as reference it is compared against the intravenous BA. Intestinal perfusion
models and in vitro methods are recommended for passively transported drugs. An
interesting alternative to intestinal tissue models is the use of in vitro systems based on the
human adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2. These cells serve as a model of small intestinal
tissue due to their ability to transport ions, sugars and peptides. The differentiated cells
exhibit the micro-villi typical of the small intestinal mucosa and the integral membrane
proteins of the brush-border enzymes. They also form the fluid-filled domes typical of a
permeable epithelium 4 .
